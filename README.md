# image_recovery
##  A program in C which recovers the deleted jpg files from the memory.

If you are on a digital Camera and you have deleted your JPG files and 
you want to recover your photos then its not an issue. Digital Cameras store these
images contiguously on the memory cards usually following the FAT file system whose block size is 
512 bytes. Here is the program which you can use to recover those deleted images provided that the old ones 
were not overwritten by the new images you have stored.

###Note: The raw file should be named as "card.raw" otherwise the program will throw some error

###> Execute the Program using CLI
